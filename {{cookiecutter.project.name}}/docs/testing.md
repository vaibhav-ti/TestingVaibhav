# Testing
Basic tests are already set up in [tests](../%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project.slug%7D%7D/tests/). You can use the sample tests as an example and add more tests as needed

To run tests locally, simply call
```commandline
bash scripts/test.sh
```


Tests also run in CI with the [test action](../.github/workflows/pytest.yml)
